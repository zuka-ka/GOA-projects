<article>The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language - a Middle-Level Language.
    The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist - Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs)
     in Murray Hill, New Jersey.
      As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance,
       default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched. 

C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983.
 ++ is shorthand for adding one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.”
